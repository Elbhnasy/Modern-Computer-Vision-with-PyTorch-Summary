# File Structure

The file structure in our repository follows a specific convention to ensure organization and maintainability. This section provides an overview of the file structure in our codebase.

As seen in the code snippet from `path/to/snippet` (see snippet), the file structure is organized as follows:

*   `src/`: This directory contains all the source code files for the project.

*   `src/components/`: This directory contains the reusable components used throughout the application.

*   `src/services/`: This directory contains the service files that handle specific functionalities of the application.

*   `src/utils/`: This directory contains utility files that provide helper functions and reusable code snippets.

*   `src/styles/`: This directory contains the CSS and SCSS files for styling the application.

*   `src/assets/`: This directory contains any static assets such as images, fonts, or icons used in the application.

Additionally, the code snippet from `path/to/snippet` (see snippet) shows an example of how the file structure is organized within the `src` directory:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Component1.tsx
│   ├── Component2.tsx
│   └── ...
├── services/
│   ├── Service1.ts
│   ├── Service2.ts
│   └── ...
├── utils/
│   ├── Utility1.ts
│   ├── Utility2.ts
│   └── ...
├── styles/
│  
```
